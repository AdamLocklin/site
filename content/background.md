Agreement complexity has risen over centuries. Sheepskin and wax seals were replaced with paper, filing cabinets, and affidavits. Electronic storage of legal contracts reduced document management costs and enabled the creation of new asset classes for investors. Yet document vaults alone are insufficient for the purposes of modern commerce which requires participants to seamlessly interconnect many back office applications and systems.

Blockchain technology enables the execution of commercial processes with a decentralized, secure, tamper-evident data set and a pathway to a global, inclusive economy. With blockchain and smart contract technology, agreements are seamlessly created, executed, audited and proved. While code is not law, enabling users to dynamically make and improve agreements on a decentralized infrastructure addresses multiple shortfalls in the market.
