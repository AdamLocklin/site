## Token economy expansion

Blockchain-based liquidity created a new generation of small and medium-sized businesses that operate in global markets. Because of creating global business models, token economy businesses need to attend to the daily operations of commerce, compliance, and risk mitigation on a scale that previously only the very largest businesses could support.

Combining a digital legal function with blockchain-based business operations allows these businesses to flow between smart contract code and enforceable prose as dynamically as their token based agreements can be made – exponentially scaling the business’s reach.

## Gig economy simplified

Blockchain is a transformative tool for more than just high-tech, high-liquidity markets; it can simultaneously support the interrelated contracting and compliance needs of individual workers paid by the task in the gig economy.

Combining the assured access of blockchain technology with a comprehensive and flexible API, the platform enables gig economy workers to track their Agreements with ease and for service providers to add extensive value to these worker's lives.

## Lawyers building infrastructure

While commerce struggles to upgrade to seamless contract management, large numbers of lawyers are struggling for revenue and new business models. The gap between legal services and the ability for clients to pay continues to grow wider each year. Blockchain based legal contract management infrastructure supports massively increased access to justice and also scalable business models for using lawyers.
