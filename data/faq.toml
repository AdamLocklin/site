        answer = """
- Certainty over whether an agreement was made
- Clarity between parties about the specifics of what was agreed
- Benefits/consideration agreed
- Mechanisms/rules of transaction
- Greater efficiency in resolving disputes
- Enforceability - ambient legal structures allow the weak to trust the strong

        question = "Why do people (or other autonomous entities) stand to gain by entering into an agreement digitally?"
        answer = """
- Computable reference object (could drive automation elsewhere)
- Cryptographic proof of agreement state (by parties timestamping, signing it, ordering it amongst other documents by hash-chaining)
- Security against loss
- Interaction with other agreements (e.g. static hierarchical, or dynamic with respect to state change)
- Updateability or freshness
- Fulfilment logs and other event streams

        question = "What is the Agreements Network built on?"
        answer = """
The Agreements Network is a hybrid solution that leverages interconnected distributed systems; specifically, it will utilize:
- [Ethereum](https://www.ethereum.org/) public blockchain for the operation of the Agreement Network's token infrastructure
- [Cosmos Hub](https://cosmos.network) -- a Proof-of-Stake blockchain to be launched by the Cosmos Network; it uses Tendermint consensus, contains a built-in governance protocol, and serves as coordinator for interoperability between other blockchains
- [InterPlanetary File System](https://ipfs.io/) (IPFS) for storage of content
- [Hyperledger Burrowâ€™s](https://github.com/hyperledger/burrow) permissioned Ethereum Virtual Machine blockchain operates our Cosmos zone
- Open source components and smart contracts built by Monax and others.
"""

        question = "What is Cosmos?"
        answer = """
- Cosmos is a network of blockchains whose purpose is to allow many sovereign and easy-to-develop blockchains to scale and interoperate with each other, creating an Internet of Blockchains.
- The first blockchain in the Cosmos network is the Cosmos hub. The Cosmos hub connects to zones via the novel IBC (inter-blockchain communication) protocol and keeps a record of the total number of tokens in each zone.
- The Cosmos Hub can connect to many different kinds of zones - public or private - as long as each zone speaks IBC. Tendermint-based Zones are natively compatible with IBC, but any fast-finality consensus algorithm can be used as a replacement.
- [See more at the Cosmos site](https://cosmos.network/intro)

        question = "Why is the Agreements Network not built on Ethereum?"
        answer = """
- The decision to not build on Ethereum was chosen in order to allow the Agreements Network to be in the most advantageous position to allow for contribution and collaboration across the ecosystem while promoting interoperability across networks.
- Monax's history has been in the development of ecosystem applications and tools. The open-sourced Monax platform, Hyperleder Burrow (ethereum virtual machine), and smart contract-based SKDs are a few examples of this. 
- Grow ecosystem applications and tools
- To allow for scaling by businesses who desire a permissioned network
- Allow for the collaboration across applications
