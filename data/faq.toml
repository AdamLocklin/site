        answer = """
- Certainty over whether an agreement was made
- Clarity between parties about the specifics of what was agreed
- Benefits/consideration agreed
- Mechanisms/rules of transaction
- Greater efficiency in resolving disputes
- Enforceability - ambient legal structures allow the weak to trust the strong

        question = "Why do people (or other autonomous entities) stand to gain by entering into an agreement digitally?"
        answer = """
- Computable reference object (could drive automation elsewhere)
- Cryptographic proof of agreement state (by parties timestamping, signing it, ordering it amongst other documents by hash-chaining)
- Security against loss
- Interaction with other agreements (e.g. static hierarchical, or dynamic with respect to state change)
- Updateability or freshness
- Fulfilment logs and other event streams
