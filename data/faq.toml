        answer = """

- Certainty over whether an agreement was made
- Clarity between parties about the specifics of what was agreed
- Mutual understanding of performance obligations 
- Greater efficiency in dispute resolution
- Enforceability means increased confidence in business decisions

        answer = """

- Computable reference objects (with the capacity to drive automation elsewhere)
- Cryptographic proof of agreement state (by parties timestamping, signing, and ordering it amongst other documents via hash-chaining
- Security against loss
- Interoperability with other agreements (e.g. static, hierarchical, dynamic)
- Tracking in real-time
- Fulfilment logs and other event streams

        answer = """
The Agreements Network is a hybrid solution leveraging interconnected, distributed systems. The four systems at the core of the Agreements Network are: 
1. [Ethereum](https://www.ethereum.org/) for the operation of the Agreement Network’s token infrastructure
2. [Cosmos Hub](https://cosmos.network) is a Proof-of-Stake blockchain to be launched by the Cosmos Network. It incorporates the Tendermint consensus, contains a built-in governance protocol, and serves as coordinator for interoperability between other blockchains [InterPlanetary File System](https://ipfs.io/) (IPFS) for distributed storage of content
3. [Hyperledger Burrow’s](https://github.com/hyperledger/burrow) is a permissioned Ethereum Virtual Machine blockchain that operates the Agreements Network’s Cosmos zone features, open-source components and smart contracts built by Monax and other developers Open source components and smart contracts built by Monax and others.

        question = "What is Cosmos?"
        answer = """
Cosmos is a network of blockchains which facilitate sovereign and easy-to-develop blockchains to scale, and with interoperability, thus creating an Internet of Blockchains 

The Cosmos Hub can connect to myriad  zones - public or private - as long as each zone communicates via theInter-Blockchain Communication (“IBC”) protocol. Tendermint-based zones are natively compatible with IBC, but any fast-finality consensus algorithm can be used as a replacement.

        answer = """
- The decision to not build on Ethereum was chosen in order to allow the Agreements Network to be in the most advantageous position to allow for contribution and collaboration across the ecosystem while promoting interoperability across networks.
- Monax's history has been in the development of ecosystem applications and tools. The open-sourced Monax platform, Hyperleder Burrow (ethereum virtual machine), and smart contract-based SKDs are a few examples of this.
- Grow ecosystem applications and tools
- To allow for scaling by businesses who desire a permissioned network
- Allow for the collaboration across applications

        question = "What is the permissioning model of the Agreements Network?"
        answer = """
The Agreements Network is a public, permissioned blockchain design. This means that for most of the users most of the time that it operates the same way as public unpermissioned blockchain networks operate. However, in order to optimize the blockchain for the use case of contract management, the founders have put in place a governance system around new smart contracts that are added to the blockchain. Because the protocol is built to be a no-code solution for almost all participants it is actually rarely the case that a user will need to add new smart contracts to the blockchain. We do not **prohibit** new smart contracts being added to the chain, however. We will be leveraging the permissioning system of Hyperledger Burrow to allow any one to *propose* new smart contracts get added to the network. These proposals are voted on by the validators. If successful, then the smart contracts are added to the chain. If unsuccessful they are not.

Tokens are used to assure the operational backbone for the Agreements Network within the proof of stake decentralized consensus mechanism. In addition,  a tokenized system offers protection against cheating and  spamming, enhancing network security

        answer = """
- The Agreements Network token is used by all participants to enhance the trust and credibility of the system
- Producers, Testers, and Validators buy tokens and place them into a bond. These are used extensively - they are contracts similar to machine-controlled escrow systems
- If users act in accordance with the Network’s rules and later wish to recover their bonds, they may do so
- If users do not act in accordance with the Network’s rules then they have a portion of their bond “slashed,” or reduced
- Tokens also provide spam protection to protect the overall operation of the Network
