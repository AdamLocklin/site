        answer = """
- Certainty over whether an agreement was made
- Clarity between parties about the specifics of what was agreed
- Benefits/consideration agreed
- Mechanisms/rules of transaction
- Greater efficiency in resolving disputes
- Enforceability - ambient legal structures allow the weak to trust the strong

        question = "Why do people (or other autonomous entities) stand to gain by entering into an agreement digitally?"
        answer = """
- Computable reference object (could drive automation elsewhere)
- Cryptographic proof of agreement state (by parties timestamping, signing it, ordering it amongst other documents by hash-chaining)
- Security against loss
- Interaction with other agreements (e.g. static hierarchical, or dynamic with respect to state change)
- Updateability or freshness
- Fulfilment logs and other event streams

The Agreements Network is a hybrid solution that leverages interconnected distributed systems; specifically, it will utilize:
- Ethereum public blockchain for the operation of the Agreement Network's token infrastructure  [https://www.ethereum.org/]
- The Cosmos Hub is a Proof-of-Stake blockchain to be launched by the Cosmos Network; it uses Tendermint consensus, contains a built-in governance protocol, and serves as coordinator for interoperability between other blockchains [https://cosmos.network/intro]
- InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) for storage of content [https://ipfs.io/]
- Hyperledger Burrowâ€™s permissioned Ethereum Virtual Machine  [https://github.com/hyperledger/burrow]
- Monax open source components (e.g. bosmarmot)  [https://github.com/monax/bosmarmot]

        question = "What is Cosmos?"
        answer = """
- Cosmos is a network of blockchains whose purpose is to allow many sovereign and easy-to-develop blockchains to scale and interoperate with each other, creating an Internet of Blockchains.  
- The first blockchain in the Cosmos network is the Cosmos hub. The Cosmos hub connects to zones via the novel IBC (inter-blockchain communication) protocol and keeps a record of the total number of tokens in each zone. 
- The Cosmos Hub can connect to many different kinds of zones - public or private - as long as each zone speaks IBC. Tendermint-based Zones are natively compatible with IBC, but any fast-finality consensus algorithm can be used as a replacement. [(https://cosmos.network/intro)]
