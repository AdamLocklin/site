        answer = """
- Certainty over whether an agreement was made
- Clarity between parties about the specifics of what was agreed
- Benefits/consideration agreed
- Mechanisms/rules of transaction
- Greater efficiency in resolving disputes
- Enforceability - ambient legal structures allow the weak to trust the strong

        answer = """
- Computable reference object (could drive automation elsewhere)
- Cryptographic proof of agreement state (by parties timestamping, signing it, ordering it amongst other documents by hash-chaining)
- Security against loss
- Interaction with other agreements (e.g. static hierarchical, or dynamic with respect to state change)
- Updateability or freshness
- Fulfilment logs and other event streams

        answer = """
The Agreements Network is a hybrid solution that leverages interconnected distributed systems; specifically, it will utilize:
- [Ethereum](https://www.ethereum.org/) public blockchain for the operation of the Agreement Network's token infrastructure
- [Cosmos Hub](https://cosmos.network) -- a Proof-of-Stake blockchain to be launched by the Cosmos Network; it uses Tendermint consensus, contains a built-in governance protocol, and serves as coordinator for interoperability between other blockchains
- [InterPlanetary File System](https://ipfs.io/) (IPFS) for storage of content
- [Hyperledger Burrowâ€™s](https://github.com/hyperledger/burrow) permissioned Ethereum Virtual Machine blockchain operates our Cosmos zone
- Open source components and smart contracts built by Monax and others.

        question = "What is Cosmos?"
        answer = """
- Cosmos is a network of blockchains whose purpose is to allow many sovereign and easy-to-develop blockchains to scale and interoperate with each other, creating an Internet of Blockchains.
- The first blockchain in the Cosmos network is the Cosmos hub. The Cosmos hub connects to zones via the novel IBC (inter-blockchain communication) protocol and keeps a record of the total number of tokens in each zone.
- The Cosmos Hub can connect to many different kinds of zones - public or private - as long as each zone speaks IBC. Tendermint-based Zones are natively compatible with IBC, but any fast-finality consensus algorithm can be used as a replacement.

        question = "Why is the Agreements Network not built on Ethereum?"
        answer = """
- The decision to not build on Ethereum was chosen in order to allow the Agreements Network to be in the most advantageous position to allow for contribution and collaboration across the ecosystem while promoting interoperability across networks.
- Monax's history has been in the development of ecosystem applications and tools. The open-sourced Monax platform, Hyperleder Burrow (ethereum virtual machine), and smart contract-based SKDs are a few examples of this.
- Grow ecosystem applications and tools
- To allow for scaling by businesses who desire a permissioned network
- Allow for the collaboration across applications

        question = "What is the permissioning model of the Agreements Network?"
        answer = """
The Agreements Network is a public, permissioned blockchain design. This means that for most of the users most of the time that it operates the same way as public unpermissioned blockchain networks operate. However, in order to optimize the blockchain for the use case of contract management, the founders have put in place a governance system around new smart contracts that are added to the blockchain. Because the protocol is built to be a no-code solution for almost all participants it is actually rarely the case that a user will need to add new smart contracts to the blockchain. We do not **prohibit** new smart contracts being added to the chain, however. We will be leveraging the permissioning system of Hyperledger Burrow to allow any one to *propose* new smart contracts get added to the network. These proposals are voted on by the validators. If successful, then the smart contracts are added to the chain. If unsuccessful they are not.
