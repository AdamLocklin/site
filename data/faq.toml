        question = "Why do people want to enter into agreements at all?"
        answer = """
- Certainty over whether an agreement was made
- Clarity between parties about the specifics of what was agreed
- Mutual understanding of performance obligations
- Greater efficiency in dispute resolution
- Enforceability means increased confidence in business decisions

        question = "What do people (or other autonomous entities) stand to gain by entering into an agreement digitally?"
        answer = """

- Computable reference objects (with the capacity to drive automation elsewhere)
- Cryptographic proof of agreement state (by parties timestamping, signing, and ordering it amongst other documents via hash-chaining
- Security against loss
- Interoperability with other agreements (e.g. static, hierarchical, dynamic)
- Tracking in real-time
- Fulfilment logs and other event streams

        question = "What is the Agreements Network built on?"
        answer = """
The Agreements Network is a hybrid solution leveraging interconnected, distributed systems. The four systems at the core of the Agreements Network are:
1. [Ethereum](https://www.ethereum.org/) for the operation of the Agreement Network’s token infrastructure
2. [Cosmos Hub](https://cosmos.network) -- a Proof-of-Stake blockchain to be launched by the Cosmos Network; it uses Tendermint consensus, contains a built-in governance protocol, and serves as coordinator for interoperability between other blockchains
3. [InterPlanetary File System](https://ipfs.io/) (IPFS) for storage of content
4. [Hyperledger Burrow’s](https://github.com/hyperledger/burrow) permissioned Ethereum Virtual Machine blockchain operates our Cosmos zone
- Open source components and smart contracts built by Monax and others.

        question = "What is Cosmos?"
        answer = """
Cosmos is a network of blockchains which facilitate sovereign and easy-to-develop blockchains to scale, and with interoperability, thus creating an Internet of Blockchains

The Cosmos Hub can connect to myriad zones - public or private - as long as each zone communicates via theInter-Blockchain Communication (“IBC”) protocol. Tendermint-based zones are natively compatible with IBC, but any fast-finality consensus algorithm can be used as a replacement For more details please visit (https://cosmos.network/intro)

        question = "What is the permissioning model of the Agreements Network?"
        answer = """
The Agreements Network is a public, permissioned blockchain design. This means that for most of the users most of the time that it operates the same way as public unpermissioned blockchain networks operate. However, in order to optimize the blockchain for the use case of contract management, the founders have put in place a governance system around new smart contracts that are added to the blockchain
Because the protocol is built to be a no-code solution for almost all participants it is rarely the case that a user will need to add new smart contracts to the blockchain
We do not prohibit new smart contracts being added to the chain, however. We will be leveraging the permissioning system of Hyperledger Burrow to allow any one to propose new smart contracts get added to the network
These proposals are voted on by the Validators - if successful, then the smart contracts are added to the chain, if unsuccessful they are not.

- As an Archetype producer to create and upload Archetypes (legal prose plus smart contract workflows) of Active Agreements
- Archetype producers do not need to have coding skills.
- Archetype producers earn a usage fee when an Active Agreement is created within the network based on their activities

        question = "Why do you have a token?"
        answer = """
A token is used to assure the operational backbone for the Agreements Network within the proof of stake decentralized consensus mechanism
A tokenized system offers protection against cheating and spamming, enhancing network security

        question = "What does the Agreements Network token do?"
        answer = """
The Agreements Network token is used by all participants to enhance the trust and credibility of the system
Producers, Testers, and Validators buy tokens and place them into a bond. These are used extensively - they are contracts similar to machine-controlled escrow systems
If users act in accordance with the Network’s rules and later wish to recover their bonds, they may do so
Tokens also provide spam protection to protect the overall operation of the Network
